 * The game consists of 10 frames as shown above. In each frame the player has 2 opportunities to knock down 10 pins. The score for the frame is the total number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.
 * A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in 2 tries. The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll. So in frame 3 above, the score is 10 (the total knocked down) plus a bonus of 5 (the number of pins knocked down on the next roll)
 * A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on their first try. The bonus for that frame is the value of the next 2 balls rolled.
 * In the 10th frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the extra balls to complete the frame. However no more than 3 balls can be rolled in the 10th frame
